# Cartridge Modernization Roadmap

## Project Goals
- Create a focused, modern NFS client specifically for gaming workloads on Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Maintain simplicity by excluding enterprise features and legacy Windows support
- Optimize for reliability and performance in gaming scenarios
- Leverage existing codebase while progressively modernizing

## Phase 1: Initial Modernization
### Project Structure
1. [ ] Convert to SDK-style project format
2. [ ] Update to modern .NET (6+)
3. [ ] Clean up V2/V4 protocol remnants
4. [ ] Implement proper logging infrastructure
5. [ ] Add initial error handling improvements

### Dependencies
1. [ ] Update NuGet package references
2. [ ] Document current Dokan integration points
3. [ ] Remove unused/legacy dependencies

## Phase 2: Core Functionality
### Stability Improvements
1. [ ] Improve mount/unmount reliability
2. [ ] Add connection state management
3. [ ] Implement basic retry logic
4. [ ] Add proper cleanup on application exit

### Performance
1. [ ] Profile current performance bottlenecks
2. [ ] Optimize read patterns for gaming workloads
3. [ ] Implement targeted caching strategies
4. [ ] Add basic performance monitoring

## Phase 3: Testing & Reliability
### Testing Infrastructure
1. [ ] Set up automated build process
2. [ ] Implement basic unit testing
3. [ ] Create integration test suite
4. [ ] Set up Windows 11 NUC testing environment

### Reliability Improvements
1. [ ] Add connection monitoring
2. [ ] Implement automatic reconnection
3. [ ] Add mount state persistence
4. [ ] Improve error recovery

## Phase 4: User Experience
### Application Improvements
1. [ ] Add system tray integration
2. [ ] Implement background service capabilities
3. [ ] Add automatic mount options
4. [ ] Improve error messaging and user feedback

### Documentation
1. [ ] Update user documentation
2. [ ] Add developer documentation
3. [ ] Document testing procedures
4. [ ] Create contribution guidelines

## Future Considerations
- Evaluate WinForms replacement options
- Assess Dokan version upgrade path
- Consider background service architecture
- Explore performance optimization opportunities

## Notes
- Focus remains on Windows 10/11 64-bit support only
- Cross-platform compatibility is not planned
- Maintaining existing Dokan integration initially
- Testing infrastructure to be implemented after core modernization
